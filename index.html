				<p>Just before the American Sociological Association's annual meeting in San Francisco, we are holding a datathon to examine contemporary urban issues - especially around housing - with municipal data from cities including San Francisco, New York, Seattle, Boston, Austin, and Chicago.</p>

				<a target="_blank" href="datathon-call-for-participation3.pdf">Full information on "Big cities, big data" here.</a>

				<h3>Judging</h3>
				<p>Judging is open to the public on August 16th from 6:30 - 8:30 at the <a href="http://www.hiltonsanfranciscohotel.com/" target="_blank">Hilton Union Square</a>, Room 3-4, Fourth Floor. Winners will be awarded a monetary prize.</p>

				<h3>Who should apply?</h3>

				<p>Social scientists, data scientists, computer scientists, municipal staffers, start-up employees, grad students, and data hackers of all stripes. Quantitative + qualitative types are welcome.</p>

				<p>People with experience doing research design, data management, statistical research, textual analysis and/or computational research are strongly encouraged to apply.</p>

				<p>Once you are accepted, expect to work with 2-4 other people from different disciplines on a common problem related to contemporary urban issues. No technical experience needed -- just come and be willing to contribute!</p>

	 			<h3>What is a datathon?</h3>

				<p>A datathon is an intense 24-hour workshop that asks researchers to do their best to turn information into knowledge. Itâ€™s a format modeled after hackathons. The difference is that datathons use research questions and datasets to advance knowledge, not to launch apps.</p>

				<p>At a datathon, participants work in teams to frame a research question, create and implement a research design, mobilize data resources and present their findings in front of a panel of judges.</p>

	 			<h3>Why is a datathon a good idea?</h3>
				<p>Datathons allow social scientists to test new research ideas and meet potential collaborators in a working environment without requiring a great deal of commitment. Ideally, a datathon is an intellectual testing pit full of the data and constructive criticism it might take months to sort out otherwise.</p>

				<h3>What happens to the work that gets done during the datathon?</h3>
				<p>Researchers are welcome to continue working on their projects after the datathon, but the goal is to have a complete or nearly complete document, image, or other deliverable (podcast? video? dataset? manifesto?) that is ready for distribution.</p>
